## Description

My layout of my portfolio was recreated and improved using the Bootstrap CSS Framework from scratch. The goal for using Bootstrap was to minimize use of media queries. Some components have been customised using my own css.

The portfolio featuring the below:

- A navigation bar, including links that navigate to the appropriate sections on the page and links that are applicable to my portfolio.
- A jumbotron/hero section featuring my picture and name
- A work section displaying mywork in grid, the use of Bootstrap cards for each project followed by a brief description.
- An About Me section
- A skills section, detaling the skills I expect to learn from the edX bootcamp.
- Contact section
- A footer section, where all hyperlinks have a hover effect and the button displays a box shadow upon hover.
