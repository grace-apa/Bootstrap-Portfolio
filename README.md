## Description

The layout of my portfolio was recreated and improved using Bootstrap's CSS Framework. The goal was to minimize the use of media queries. However, some components have been styled using my own customised css.

The portfolio features the below:

- A navigation bar, including links that navigate to the appropriate sections on the page and links that are applicable to my portfolio.
- A jumbotron/hero section featuring my picture and name
- A work section displaying mywork in grid, the use of Bootstrap cards for each project followed by a brief description.
- An About Me section
- A skills section, detaling the skills I expect to learn from the edX bootcamp.
- Contact section
- A footer section, where all hyperlinks have a hover effect and the button displays a box shadow upon hover.
